    <sentence n="1"><line><speaker id="frame" part="start"/>I met a traveller from an antique land,</line>
        <line>Who said—<speaker id="inner" part="start"/>“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone </line>
        <line>Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,</line>
        <line>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</line>
        <line>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</line>
        <line>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</line>
        <line>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</line>
        <line>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</line>
        <line>And on the pedestal, these words appear:</line>
        <line>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</line>
        <line>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</line>
        <line>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</line>
        <line>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</line>
        <line>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<speaker id="inner" part="end"/><speaker id="frame" part="end"/></line></sentence>
